# Redirect file.
# This file contains the list of rewrite rules that are applied when serving
# pages.
#
# Each redirect has four parts:
#
# - src: The path to redirect. This is a regex rule prefixed with an implied
#   '^'. Unless you're doing something advanced, your path should start with
#   '/' character.
#
# - dst: The path to redirect to. If the path begins with a slash,
#   it is considered a relative redirect. Otherwise, it is an absolute
#   redirct (and should probably begin with http: or http://). You may use
#   capturing groups to preserve part of the source path. To referece a
#   capturing group, use \N, where N is the (1-based) index of desired group.
#
# - type: Either 'permanent' or 'temporary', depending on whether you want an
#   HTTP 301 or HTTP 302 redirect, respectiviely. See RFC 2616 for the
#   difference between these:
#
#       http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616
#
#   If you don't specify a type, 'permanent' will be used by default. Note that
#   this is different from the Apache convention (which uses 'temporary' by
#   default.)
#
# - comment: Currently ignored by the computer, but useful for humans.
#
# Example:
#
# redirects:
# - src: /foo
#   dst: /bar
#   # Redirect /foo to /bar. This will also redirect foo/ and
#   # foo/test.html. Note that the redirect type is optional. This will be
#   # treated as a permanent redirect.
#
# - src: /(.+droid(/.*)?)$
#   dst: /droids/\1
#   type: permanent
#   # Redirect /android to /droids/android and /bugdroid to
#   # /droids/bugdroid. However, it will not redirect /droid or
#   # /bugdroids.

#
# - src: /google
#   dst: http://www.google.com
#   type: temporary
#   # This is an example of a redirect to an absolute URI.
#
#
#   WATCH OUT -- SRC LINE HAS TO START WITH A HYPHEN !!
