<p>Demonstrates how to create a DelayedConfirmationView in your wearable app. In this sample,

activity displays a DelayedConfirmationView that starts when the user presses "Start Timer." Then,
callbacks are implemented on both the wearable and phone to show when the timer is selected or
finishes.</p>
