<p>This sample provides an example of an app that uses Google Play Services Wearable Data APIs to
communicate between applications on a phone and a paired wearable device. Users can create quiz
questions on the phone, each of which has a DataItem associated with it. These DataItems are then
received on the wearable, which then displays them as notifications. Each notification contains the
question as the first page, followed by answers as actions. When an answer is selected, the
corresponding question's DataItem is updated, which allows the phone application to update the
status of the question (i.e. did the user answer it correctly or not) and prompt the next question.

<p>At the end of the quiz, the sample uses the Google Play Services Wearable Message APIs to create
an end-of-quiz report notification on the wearable, with an option to reset the quiz (by sending a
message back to the phone).
