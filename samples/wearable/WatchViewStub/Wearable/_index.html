<p>This sample demonstrates how to specify different layouts for round and rectangular screens.
The layouts used in this sample are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Round:  The background is a blue/green ring surrounding red text.</li>
        <li>Rect:   The background is a blue/breen rounded rectangle with red text on top.</li>
    </ul>
Additionally, a unique animation is played when the user clicks on the layout, depending on whether
the screen is round or rectangular:
    <ul>
        <li>Round:  The layout rotates 360 degrees.</li>
        <li>Rect:   The layout shrinks to 70% and then grows back to 100%.</li>
    </ul>
